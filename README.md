#BSDF_Demo

This demo is a scholar project where the initial goal was to implement two rendering functions which are: the Lambertian diffusion function and the diffusion and specular function of Cook-Torrance coming from their paper entitled: "A reflectance model for Computer Graphics" [1982].

I added an implementation allowing a reflection on metallic surface from static environment map.
In the future, I intent to add refraction rendering  BTDF function to complete this project as BSDF demo.
